== CSR

These functions concern the CSR:

`uint64_t csr_get_cycle(void)`

* Get the current cycle count since last reset as a 64-bit unsigned number.

`uint64_t csr_get_instret(void)`

* Get the number of retired instructions since last reset as a 64-bit unsigned number.

`uint64_t csr_get_time(void)`

* Get the number of microseconds since last reset as a 64-bit unsigned number.

`uint64_t csr_get_mhpmcounter3(void)` +
`uint64_t csr_get_mhpmcounter4(void)` +
`uint64_t csr_get_mhpmcounter5(void)` +
`uint64_t csr_get_mhpmcounter6(void)` +
`uint64_t csr_get_mhpmcounter7(void)` +
`uint64_t csr_get_mhpmcounter8(void)` +
`uint64_t csr_get_mhpmcounter9(void)`

* Get the number of counter events since last reset as a 64-bit unsigned number. Note: Zihpm extenion must be enabled in the hardware.
