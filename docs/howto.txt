Have a look at:

* apt install texinfo

* type in command:

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain

* wait for the cloning to be completed (takes a long time)

* cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
* mkdir build; cd build

* ../configure --help | grep abi
    --with-abi=lp64d        Sets the base RISC-V ABI, defaults to lp64d
  
* ../configure --prefix=/opt/riscv32 --with-arch=rv32im --with-abi=ilp32
  checking for gcc... gcc
  ...
  config.status: creating Makefile
  config.status: creating scripts/wrapper/awk/awk
  config.status: creating scripts/wrapper/sed/sed

Note that ilp32 specifies that int, long, and pointers are all 32-bits

After configure is complete, we can make our code. Note that make also performs an install into the path specified by --prefix: /opt/riscv32. 

* make
  (takes a long time) 




* export PATH=/opt/riscv32/bin:$PATH
