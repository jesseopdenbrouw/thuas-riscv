# On-chip debugger files

There are two files:

* `openocd.cfg` - OpenOCD configuration file
* `thuasrv32.svd` - SVD file (for example for Eclipse)

On-chip debugging is tested with a FTDI 2232H mini module (e.g. [FT2232H mini module](https://ftdichip.com/products/ft2232h-mini-module/))) which is a cheap debugging tool. The SVD file can be used in Eclipse for easy inspection of the peripherals.
