# Basel Problem

Program to calculate the result of the Basel Problem

## Description

The Basel Problem is a classic problem of the summation
of the inverses of integer squares. Solved by Euler.

The resulting number is pi^2/6 = +/- 1.64...
The result is converging slow so you need at least
1000 steps.

This program can be used to test the divider unit
because there are a lot of divisions.

## Status

Works in simulation. You need to simulate for 5 ms.
