Test running of HPM counters

## Description

This program tests the working of the implemented HPM counters.
Only counters 3 to 9 are implemented. The remaining counters
all return all zero when reading. Writes are ignored. Note that
the Zihpm extension must be enabled.

## Status

Works on the board.
