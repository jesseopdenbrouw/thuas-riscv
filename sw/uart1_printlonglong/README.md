# uart1_printlonglong

Print signed/unsigned long long integers

## Description

The `nano` library does not support printing (un)signed long long integers,
a.k.a. 64-bit integers. Using the UART1 library, it is possible to print them.

# Status

Works on the board. You need a Serial to USB device and a terminal program like Putty.
