# whetstone

The Whetstone FP benchmark

## Description

This is the Whetstone benchmark for the THUAS
processor. Since the processor does not have
an FPU, the score is low

Note that this program must be linked with `-u _printf_float`

Adapted from https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-sdk/tree/master/application/baremetal/benchmark/whetstone_v1.2

## Status

Works on the board.
